## Week 2; JAVASCRIPT
- Actually a programming language, unlike CSS and HTML (which are about structure and style specifically to documents)
- So far, pretty standard programming language basics
- console.log()
    - writes to the console
    - very useful for testing
- "Object" data type
    - stores several values with keys
    - Ways to store values with specific keys. different than array
    - like dictionaries in python
- Array values have positions within the array (unlike above)
- semicolons at end of lines
    - not technically necessary but recommended to indicate where lines end
- Variables
    - let
        - re-assignable local variable
    - const
        - unchangeable value after value is set. value can be updated if its an object
    - var
        - function or globally scoped variable
- assignment operators: "=[operator (eg + - * etc)]
- === for "is value same and is type the same" 
    - a little strange
- for and while loops
    - for loops work the same way (getting values from variables works differently than python)
    - while loops work
- Functions (in Javascript)
    - curly brackets {}
    - return (to determine "export")

- call javascript code from javascript file using `<script>` element
